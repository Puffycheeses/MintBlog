Install
-
1. `git clone https://github.com/Puffycheeses/MintBlog.git` into your web server's directory
2. Create a file called `posts.json` in `Data` and follow the `README` in the `Data` directory
3. Visit the webpage

How does it work
-
MintBlog is as basic as it comes, Simpily write your post in a .txt file and add an entry to your posts.json and it does the rest. 

If you wish to change the styling `style.css` has some basics but `reviewConstruct.js` has the draw function.
