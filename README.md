=
MintBlog aims to be an easy to use and setup webpage that can display static information  neatly formatted to create a sleak easy to read blog.

Install
-
1. Move the directory `MintBlog` to your web servers directory and rename it to whatever you want
2. Create a file called `posts.json` in `Data` and follow the `README` in the `Data` directory
3. Visit the webpage

How does it work
-
MintBlog is as basic as it comes, Simpily write your post in a .txt file and add an entry to your posts.json and it does the rest. 

If you wish to change the styling `style.css` has some basics but `reviewConstruct.js` has the draw function.
